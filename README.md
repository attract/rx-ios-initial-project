# rx-ios-initial-project
Second generation of iOS Initial Project - Project with lots of pre-installed libraries and frameworks for fast and simple project-up.

# Features
There are five categories of features in this project:
- managers;
- helpers;
- extensions;
- superclass for all view controllers with built-in funtions;
- other third-party libraries.

# Preinstalled managers
1. `APIManager` is ready to use API-manager (uses `RxAlamofire` framework).
2. `TokenManager` is ready to use manager for application's OAuth authorization.
3. `PushManager` is ready to use push notifications manager.

# Helpers
1. `DateTimeFormatter` is class for converting dates and times from `Date` object to `String` (for output) or `String` to `Date` for input. 
2. `ProgressLoader` is class for showing loading indicators while some continues actions are running (i.e. network queries). It uses `SVProgressHUD` framework.
3. `Alerter` is powerfull popup generator system. It uses `BulletinBoard` framework for displaying interactive messages with actions instead of system `UIAlertController`. Popups are made according to new iOS 11 guidelines and looks like AirPods connection card. 
4. `TapticEngine` class is made for awesome haptic feedback in response to some user's actions. It uses TapticEngine on iPhones 6s and higher. It works greate with `Alerter`.


# Extensions
What is Extension? It's addition to existing Swift classes, that allows to do more with system classes. Here is our extensions list with our additions:

1. `NSLayoutConstraint` extension allows to set constraint's multiplier programatically. By default, it can be changes in InterfaceBuilder only.
2. `NumberExtension` gives abbility to round float values to needed characters number after coma.
3. `StringExtension` implements lots of additions:
    - `localized` - returnes localized string value. Just call `myString.localized` instead of `NSLocalizedString(myString, tableName: tableName, bundle: Bundle.main, value: value, comment: comment)`;
    - `trimmed` - removes whitespaces from string. Just call `myString.trimmed` instead of `myString.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)`;
    - `substring` - cuts string to needed range;
    - `urlencoded` - returns url-encoded string. Just call `myString.urlencoded` instead of `myString.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlHostAllowed)`;
    - `withoutHTMLTags` - removes all HTML-tags from string. Just call `myString.withoutHTMLTags` instead of `myString.replacingOccurrences(of: "<[^>]+>", with: "", options: .regularExpression, range: nil)`;
    - `getAttributedStringFromHTML` - function that allows to convert html-string to attributed string for displaying with needed attributes.
    - `+` allows easily concatanate to string or attributed strings. Just call `output = string1 + string2`;
    - `setAsLink` function sets as clickable link needed part of attribute string.
4. `UIColorExtension` brings support for next features:
    - initizlize color from hex-string;
    - create an image which is filled bu needed color.
5. `UIImageExtension` allows to do next things:
    - `rounded` allows easily create round image from regular. Just call `myImage.rounded`;
    - `imageWithCorrectOrientation` fixes invalid orientation in images which are made with system camera; 
    - `imageWithColor` filles non-filled parts of image with selected color.
6. `UIImageViewExtension` brings nexr cool features:
    - loading image from web and save it to cache, displaying this image from cache, make image round, display loading progress in just one single line of code: `myImageView.image(from: urlString, withPlaceholder: placeholderImage, isRounded: true, progressHandler: { // display progress if needed })`. Without this extension we have to write about 30 lines of code to make this;
    - make imageView round. In some cases we need to show round image, but we also need image in non-round state. With this extension we can make rounded just image container without rounding original image.
    - show and hide activity indicators on imageViews while images are loading from web.
7. `UINavigationControllerExtension` allows to add ability for adding handlers after view controller is pushed or poped. 
8. `UITableViewCellExtension` allows to add customized separators to UITableviewCell programaticaly.
9. `UITextFieldExtension` allows to set paddings to text fields.
10. `UIViewExtension` brings ability to customize some view's propertes dircetly from interface builder. They are `cornerRadius` (for making round corners), `borderWidth` and `borderColor`.
11. `UIDeviceExtension` allows to get current device model in readable mode. Needed for actions which are dependent from device model.

# BasicViewController: Superclass for all ViewControllers
All view controllers in app are subclassed from `BasicViewController`. Here is list of properies and functions which are already implemented in BasicViewController (and are available in all subclasses):
1. `ReachabilityManager` item.
2. `BulletinManager` item. Is used for popups.
3. `showAuthScreen` method allows direct navigation to authorization screen.
4. `logout` method erases all user data and calls `showAuthScreen`.
5. `showMainScreen` method navigates to root screen of app.
6. `showErrorScreen` method displays errors' messages. Uses `Alerter`.
7. `handleErrors` method processes all errors in application and shows relevant message to user. Uses `Alerter`.
8. `showApproriateAlert` method is used in form validators. It shows incorrectly filled field and sets focus to this field.
9. `Alerter` methods (all of them use `TapticEngine`):
    - `showSuccess` displays message about succesfully finished task;
    - `showWarning` displays warning message;
    - `showError` displays error message with "Retry" button;
    - `showCustom` displays fully customized popup with custom action handlers;
    - `showConfirm` displays confirm alert popup with two actions "Confirm" and "Cancel";
    - `showInfo` displays information message.
10. `makeTapticFeedback` uses `TapticEngine` and provides haptic feedback. Can use on of three presets:
    - success;
    - warning;
    - error.
11. And now lots of reactive properties, just check them! 

As a result, all view controllers that are subclassed from BasicViewController are supporting all these features fully codeless.

# Other third-party libraries and frameworks
All third-party libraries are open-sourced.

In this list there are no frameworks which are used in managers, helpers and extension.
- `DZNEmptyDataSet` allows to setup customizable views to empty lists;
- `CCBottomRefreshControl`. Yes, by default iOS doesn't support infinity scrolling. With this framework we can implement this functionallity in our apps;
- `SKPhotoBrowser` is a simple image viewer. I.e. it allows to view fullsize image after tapping on image thumbnail;
- `Fabric` and `Crashlytics` allows to send beta versions to testers without TestFlight.

# Requres:
- `cocoapods` preinstalled

If you do not have cocoapods installed, then just run this command in terminal:
```sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

# How to start making project using AppSample:

 1. Open `rx-ios-initial-project.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
 2. Navigate to project settings.
 3. Change Name in all project's targets to needed.
 4. Change Bundle identifier to `com.new_app_name.ios.app`
 5. Close project.
 6. Open `terminal.app` and navigate to `.xcodeproj` directory
 
Now you need to init pods project in future workspace. Run this:
```sh
$ pod init
```
Once workspace is initialized, you need to install required pods. Run this:
```sh
$ open Podfile
```
Add next lines to your target section:

```
pod 'RxSwift'
pod 'RxCocoa'
pod 'ReachabilitySwift'
pod 'DZNEmptyDataSet'
pod 'RxKingfisher'
pod 'RxAlamofire'
pod 'KeychainAccess'
pod 'RxKeyboard'
pod 'SVProgressHUD'
pod 'RxGesture'
pod 'JMMaskTextField-Swift'
pod 'BulletinBoard'
```

# Next steps

Close `terminal.app` and open `.xworkspace` file. That's all! Now your app has all needed features for comfortable development. Enjoy :)
